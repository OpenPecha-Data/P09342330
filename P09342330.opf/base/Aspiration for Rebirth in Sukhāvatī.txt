I feel no pain and am reborn in the realm of great bliss!

Born in the presence of the Victorious One ‘Blazing with Thousands of Radiant Marks’,1

May I receive a prophecy of my ultimate enlightenment,

May I gain mastery of the profound Dharma treasury of the Victorious Ones,

And may my emanations benefit sentient beings throughout the whole of space!

In particular, may all those who have a connection with me,

Even those beings who have merely heard my name,

Completely purify their karma, kleśas, evil deeds, obscurations and sufferings,

And may they be born in the realm of Sukhāvatī!
